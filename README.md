# Django-Assignment

1. Create a Django Application to show the blogs stored in a Blog table. Render a
landing/home page when a user hits the Base URL. Add a navigation button on the
home page to the blog page which opens all the blogs and the author of the blogs stored
in the Blog table. The blog table should also have the fields ‘created_at’ and
‘updated_at’. There should be a separate Author table and the relationship between two
tables should be maintained.
You can add or delete the blogs and the authors from Django-admin.
